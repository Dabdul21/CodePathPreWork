# Prework - *ButtonAlter*

Submitted by: **Dayan Abdulla**

**AboutWho** This is my Swift app for a small pre-work project. When it opens, it hides extra info about me until you flip a switch. 
There's also a button that makes the background color randomly change every time you press it.
I used a container to hold all my labels neatly, with rounded corners to make it look nicer. The extra info has a gray background for easy reading.
[TODO] 
- Add sound effects when the button or switch is used.

- Allow users to pick a favorite color to save as the background.

Time spent: **1** hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ X ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ X ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

Glimpse is an app where people post quick 10 second clips from their day.
Once someone watches it, it’s gone and they can’t rewatch it. 
There’s no likes or comments, just real random moments. 
You can tag the mood of the clip like peaceful or chaotic, and the app shows you clips that match that mood. 
It also saves one random clip from your week just for you to look back on. 
It’s more about sharing life as it is, not trying to be perfect.

## Notes

I ran into an issue while i was making the background for my text. I found out that labels cant have textContainerInsets
I left the code commented out to show how i tried to do it.
